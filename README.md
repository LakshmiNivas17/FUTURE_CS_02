SOC Project – Incident Response Simulation
📌 Overview

This project provides a beginner-friendly introduction to the core activities of a Security Operations Center (SOC).
The main focus is on monitoring security alerts, analyzing potential threats, and simulating incident response — just like a SOC analyst would in a real-world environment.

It simulates how SOC teams work 24/7 to keep organizations safe from cyberattacks by detecting suspicious activities early and responding quickly.

🎯 Project Objectives

Understand the fundamentals of Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows.

Gain hands-on experience with security alerts and log analysis.

Learn how to classify incidents by severity (High, Medium, Low).

Document findings in a structured Incident Response Report.

Recommend remediation strategies to mitigate risks.

🛠️ Features

Analysis of malware alerts and failed login attempts.

Classification of incidents based on priority levels.

Creation of a detailed incident timeline.

Comprehensive Impact Assessment & Recommendations section.

Automated generation of Incident Response Report (Word format).

📂 Dataset Used

malware_alerts_02.csv – Sample logs simulating malware detection.

failed_logins_01.csv – Sample logs representing failed login attempts.

Both datasets were parsed and analyzed to identify potential threats.

📑 Report Output

The final deliverable is a professional Incident Response Report, which includes:

Executive Summary

Incident Classification (with counts)

Timeline of Major Events

Impact Assessment

Remediation Recommendations

Appendix with detailed incident logs
